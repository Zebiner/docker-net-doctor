# Security Scan Report
Generated: $(date -u)

## Scan Results Overview

- **Code Security (gosec)**: Not available (installation issue)
- **Static Analysis (staticcheck)**: 12 issues found (mostly compilation errors)
- **Known Vulnerabilities (govulncheck)**: ✅ No vulnerabilities found
- **Basic Secret Detection**: 20+ matches found (mostly false positives in test files)

## Detailed Analysis

### Vulnerability Scanning (govulncheck)
✅ **PASSED** - No known vulnerabilities detected in dependencies

### Static Analysis (staticcheck)
⚠️ **ISSUES FOUND** - Multiple compilation errors need fixing:
- Undefined variables: `outputFormat`, `verbose`, `timeout` in main.go
- Import issues with unused packages
- Type definition mismatches in test files
- Docker client interface mismatches

### Secret Detection (Basic)
⚠️ **REVIEW NEEDED** - Found potential secret references:
- Test files contain expected "secret" strings (false positives)
- No actual credentials detected
- All matches appear to be test data or variable names

## Recommendations

1. **Fix compilation issues** - Address undefined variables in main.go
2. **Update test files** - Resolve type mismatches and import issues  
3. **Install gosec** - Need proper gosec installation for code security analysis
4. **Review secret scanning** - Implement TruffleHog for advanced secret detection
5. **Integrate security into CI/CD** - Use the GitHub Actions workflow created

## Security Baseline Established

- Dependencies: Clean (no known vulnerabilities)
- Code compilation: Issues present that block security analysis
- Secret exposure: Low risk (test files only)
- Overall security posture: Moderate (needs compilation fixes)

## Next Steps

1. Fix compilation errors to enable full security analysis
2. Install gosec properly for code security scanning
3. Run complete security scan after fixes
4. Integrate security scanning into development workflow
5. Set up automated security monitoring
