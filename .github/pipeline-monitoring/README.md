### Troubleshooting

#### Pipeline Running Slowly
1. Check recent performance reports for bottlenecks
2. Review cache hit rates - may need optimization
3. Look for infrastructure issues or runner problems
4. Consider if recent changes introduced performance regression

#### Cache Not Working
1. Verify cache keys are stable and predictable
2. Check for cache size limits or corruption
3. Review cache optimization recommendations
4. Consider manual cache cleanup

#### Alerts Not Working  
1. Verify GitHub permissions for issue creation
2. Check workflow execution logs for errors
3. Ensure alert thresholds are properly configured
4. Test manual workflow dispatch
