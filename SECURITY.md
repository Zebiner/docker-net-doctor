# Security Policy and Practices

## Security Scanning Integration

Docker Network Doctor now includes comprehensive security scanning tools to ensure code quality and vulnerability detection.

### Available Security Tools

1. **gosec** - Go security analyzer for code vulnerabilities
2. **staticcheck** - Advanced static analysis for code quality  
3. **govulncheck** - Known vulnerability detection in dependencies
4. **nancy** - OSS Index dependency vulnerability scanner
5. **TruffleHog** - Secret detection in code and commits
6. **Semgrep** - Semantic security analysis
7. **Trivy** - Container image vulnerability scanning

### Local Security Scanning

#### Quick Security Check
```bash
make security-quick
```
Runs essential scans (gosec + govulncheck) for rapid feedback during development.

#### Complete Security Scan
```bash
make security
```
Runs all available security tools and generates comprehensive reports.

#### Install Security Tools
```bash
make security-install-tools
```
Downloads and installs all required security scanning tools.

#### Individual Scans
```bash
make security-gosec        # Code security analysis
make security-staticcheck  # Static code analysis
make security-govulncheck  # Known vulnerability detection
make security-nancy        # Dependency vulnerability scan
make security-secrets      # Basic secret detection
make security-docker       # Docker image security scan
```

### Security Configuration Files

- `.gosec.json` - gosec security scanner configuration
- `staticcheck.conf` - staticcheck analysis configuration  
- `.semgrepignore` - Semgrep scanning exclusions
- `.trivyignore` - Trivy vulnerability exclusions
- `.trufflehog.yaml` - TruffleHog secret scanning configuration

### CI/CD Security Integration

The project includes automated security scanning via GitHub Actions:

- **Vulnerability Scanning** - Daily govulncheck runs
- **Code Security Analysis** - gosec on every commit
- **Static Analysis** - staticcheck for code quality
- **Dependency Auditing** - nancy for dependency vulnerabilities
- **Secret Detection** - TruffleHog for exposed credentials
- **Container Scanning** - Trivy for Docker image vulnerabilities

Security scans run automatically on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Daily scheduled scans
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Security Baseline

Current security status (as of last scan):

✅ **Dependencies**: No known vulnerabilities
⚠️ **Code Analysis**: Compilation issues prevent full analysis  
✅ **Secrets**: No exposed credentials detected
⚠️ **Overall**: Moderate security posture

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers

1. **Run security scans locally** before committing:
   ```bash
   make security-quick
   ```

2. **Address high-severity findings immediately**
3. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
4. **Never commit secrets** or credentials
5. **Use secure coding practices** for Docker operations

#### For Maintainers

1. **Review security scan results** in PR checks
2. **Address critical vulnerabilities** within 24 hours
3. **Update security tools** quarterly
4. **Monitor security advisories** for dependencies
5. **Maintain security documentation**

### Reporting Security Issues

To report security vulnerabilities:

1. **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for investigation and patching
5. Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Security Tool Configuration

#### gosec Configuration
- Enabled rules: G101-G601 (comprehensive security checks)
- Output format: SARIF for GitHub integration
- Excludes: Test files and generated code
- Severity threshold: Medium

#### staticcheck Configuration  
- Checks: All security and quality checks
- Go version target: 1.21+
- Output: JSON for automation
- Confidence threshold: 0.8

#### govulncheck Configuration
- Database: https://vuln.go.dev
- Scan level: Symbol-level analysis
- Mode: Source code analysis
- Updates: Automatic via CI/CD

### Security Metrics and Monitoring

The security scanning generates reports in `security-reports/`:
- `gosec.sarif` - Security vulnerability analysis
- `staticcheck.json` - Code quality analysis
- `govulncheck.json` - Known vulnerability scan
- `nancy.json` - Dependency vulnerability audit
- `secrets-basic.txt` - Basic secret detection
- `security-summary.md` - Comprehensive security report

### Emergency Security Response

In case of critical security vulnerabilities:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-4 hours)
   - Assess impact and severity
   - Create private security advisory
   - Begin patch development

2. **Short-term Response** (4-24 hours)
   - Develop and test security patch
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Coordinate disclosure timeline

3. **Long-term Response** (1-7 days)
   - Release security patch
   - Publish security advisory
   - Update security documentation
   - Conduct post-incident review

### Compliance and Standards

This project follows security best practices including:
- OWASP secure coding guidelines
- Go security best practices
- Container security standards
- Supply chain security measures
- Automated vulnerability management

For questions about security practices or to report vulnerabilities, please contact the project maintainers.
